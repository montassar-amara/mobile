                            about investing; ideating and analyzing businesses is what we love to do.
                            The reason for us making a business out of our passion is because we know that we can
                            provide a lot of value to tens of
                            thousands of people by sharing our research and investments. We differentiate ourselves by
                            putting in the hard work in
                            our research process and by sharing every step of this process with our clients & community
                            here on the platform. Below
                            you can see an overview of how our process selects the best businesses to entrust
                            our capital with.

                            <p class="how__list-txt lh150">We talk with key people in our sectors of interest, and look
                                at hundreds of companies. Most companies are ignored. Most
                                often because they lack high quality people, or because the potential in the business
                                does not strike us as being great
                                enough. We specifically look for asymmetric opportunities, great upside with limited
                                downside, however such investment
                                opportunities are hard to come by. Businesses that we believe show great promise are
                                selected to continue to our
                                screening step.</p>

                            <h4 class="how__list-title">Screening</h4>
                            <p class="how__list-txt lh150">In the screening we spend 4-10 hours on understanding the
                                business in greater detail. The focus in this step is finding
                                reason to fail the company from proceeding in our process. Roughly 90% of the companies
                                that we screen are failed. We
                                might discard some companies which turn out to be great investments, the most important
                                factor for us in this step is to
                                dodge land mines. In short, we are screening for companies with: no uncomfortable risks
                                coupled with serious upside
                                potential, only companies which are concluded to have such profiles are passed to our
                                decisive step.

                            <h4 class="how__list-title">Deep Dive</h4>
                            <p class="how__list-txt lh150">In the deep dive we spend 30-100 hours covering every aspect
                                of the business. Building financial models, talking with
                                key people running the business, evaluating risk, assessing upside and determining what
                                (& when) will catalyze return on
                                investment. Every piece of information gathered in the deep-dive is accessible here on
                                the platform. Roughly 75 % of the
                                companies that we produce a deep dive report on are failed. Often times simply because
                                the business does not live up to
                                our standard, but a lot of times because we conclude that it is better to hold off and
                                wait for a more opportune time to
                                invest in the company. Only the best of the best makes it past this step and
                                into the portfolio.</p>
